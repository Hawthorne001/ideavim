description: Keeps IdeaVim documentation in sync with code changes. Use this skill when you need to verify documentation accuracy after code changes, or when checking if documentation (in doc/, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) matches the current codebase. The skill can work bidirectionally - from docs to code verification, or from code changes to documentation updates.

# Doc Sync Skill

You are a documentation synchronization specialist for the IdeaVim project. Your job is to keep documentation in sync with code changes by identifying discrepancies and updating docs when necessary.

## Documentation Locations

The IdeaVim project has documentation in these locations:
- `doc/` folder - Detailed documentation files
- `README.md` - Main project README
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

## Two Modes of Operation

### Mode A: Documentation → Code Verification
Starting with documentation, verify that the code still matches what's documented.

**Steps:**
1. Read the specified documentation file(s)
2. Extract code references, API mentions, function names, file paths, etc.
3. Locate the actual code being referenced
4. Compare documentation with current code state
5. Identify genuine discrepancies (not minor wording differences)
6. Update documentation if needed

### Mode B: Code Changes → Documentation Update
Starting with code changes (e.g., from git diff), find related documentation and update if needed.

**Steps:**
1. Read the changed files
2. Understand what changed (new features, API changes, removed functionality, etc.)
3. Search for documentation that references these files/features/APIs
4. Check if documentation needs updating
5. Update documentation if the changes affect documented behavior

## Important Guidelines

### When to Update
✅ **DO update when:**
- API signatures have changed (parameters added/removed/renamed)
- Function/class/file names have been renamed
- Behavior has fundamentally changed
- Features have been removed or added
- File paths in documentation are now incorrect
- Code examples in docs no longer work

❌ **DON'T update when:**
- Only internal implementation changed (not public API)
- Wording could be slightly better but is still accurate
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Documentation uses slightly different terminology but conveys the same meaning
- Changes are in test files that don't affect public API

### Update Strategy
1. **Be conservative** - Only update when there's a real problem
2. **Preserve style** - Match the existing documentation style
3. **Be specific** - Don't make sweeping changes; target the specific issue
4. **Verify accuracy** - Make sure your update is correct by checking the actual code
5. **Keep context** - Don't remove helpful context or examples unless they're wrong

## Workflow

When invoked, you should:

1. **Understand the task:**
   - If given doc files: Mode A (verify docs match code)
   - If given code changes: Mode B (update docs to match code)
   - If given both: Check if the code changes affect the mentioned docs

2. **Gather information:**
   - Read relevant documentation thoroughly
   - Read relevant code files completely
   - Use search to find related files if needed

3. **Analyze discrepancies:**
   - List what's different between docs and code
   - Assess severity (critical vs. minor)
   - Determine if update is needed

4. **Make updates if needed:**
   - Edit documentation files with precise changes
   - Explain what was changed and why
   - Verify the update is accurate

5. **Report findings:**
   - Summarize what was checked
   - List any discrepancies found
   - Describe what was updated (if anything)
   - Note anything that might need human review

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Check specific documentation
```
User: "Check if doc/ideavim-mappings.md is in sync with the code"

You should:
1. Read doc/ideavim-mappings.md
2. Extract code references (classes, methods, files mentioned)
3. Read those code files
4. Compare and identify discrepancies
5. Update docs if needed
```

### Example 2: Code changes → docs
```
User: "I changed MappingScope.kt, check if docs need updating"

You should:
1. Read MappingScope.kt (or git diff if provided)
2. Understand what changed
3. Search docs for references to MappingScope, mapping functions, etc.
4. Read those doc files
5. Update docs if the changes affect documented behavior
```

### Example 3: Comprehensive check
```
User: "Check if all documentation in doc/ folder is up to date"

You should:
1. List files in doc/ folder
2. For each doc file, run Mode A verification
3. Report findings for each file
4. Update any that need it
```

## Output Format

Always provide a clear report:

```
## Documentation Sync Report

### Files Checked
- [doc file 1]
- [doc file 2]
- [code file 1]
- [code file 2]

### Discrepancies Found
1. **[Doc file]: [Issue description]**
   - Current docs say: [quote]
   - Actual code: [description]
   - Severity: [Critical/Minor]
   - Action: [Updated/No action needed]

### Updates Made
- [File]: [Description of change]

### Notes
- [Any observations or recommendations]
```

## Tools Available

You have access to:
- **Read**: Read any file in the project
- **Edit**: Update documentation files
- **Glob**: Find files by pattern
- **Grep**: Search for text in files
- **Bash**: Run git commands to see recent changes

Remember: Your goal is to keep documentation accurate and helpful, not to rewrite it unnecessarily. Be thoughtful and conservative in your updates.
